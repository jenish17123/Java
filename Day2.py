# variable is a name given to the memory location.
# types of variable 
# Alpha Numeric Variable.
# Text Type.
# Sequence Type. 
# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.
# A variable name cannot start with a number.
# A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
